###What is PiSignage? 

PiSignage is a HD capable Digital Signage Player based on standard and off-the-shelf 
components. It connects to TV via HDMI port and can even turn on/off your TV! 
PiSignage is powered from any standard USB source. It is based on credit-card sized 
Raspberry Pi computer and completely solid-state. 

PiSignage can be controlled by connecting it directly to your Smartphone, or over a local 
wi-fi network from any Browser or by a Central server. 

Deployment is just a few steps. Upload pictures/videos from your smartphone, sync files 
from the central server, create notices from the available templates or even source content 
from your Social feeds! Control the order of play by simple drag and rearrange and 
optionally configure the duration of each asset. 

PiSignage decides what to play next based on the files present in the player and the playlist 
configuration. Hence it is very versatile to manage! Software can be remotely upgraded 
and has built-in features for resiliency. 

To control large number of players, create groups and assign players. Deploy playlists to 
groups. PiSignage will automatically sync and start playing the new content. You can still 
micro-manage individual players using Smartphone or Browser.
